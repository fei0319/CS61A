## Course Info

The purpose of CS61A is to teach you the core concepts of computer science. CS61A is not about learning a particular programming language, though the course does introduce the Python programming language and uses it, along with a little Scheme and SQL, to teach programming concepts. This course concentrates on the idea of abstraction and using this idea to solve problems. The course considers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.
